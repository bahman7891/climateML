# Machine Learning Climate Study

**ClimateML** is a cloud based study on climate using merely the historic data. The questions sorrounding such study is still under development however the major topics are:
  - Is it at all possible to use historic data to predict certain quantities characterizing the climate.
  - If the above question has positive answer, which characteristics are predictable ?
  - Is it also possible to use thermodynamic models as part of such predictive modeling ?
  - Is it feasible to include the emission and other chemical ingredients data into the modeling?
  - If the answer to the above question is positive, is it possible to study global warming or in general, global effects ? Or local warmings/ local effects ?

The above questions will be modified and edited as study goes along.

## Cloud Based

This study is using AWS resources on a limited budget. The resouces will be indicated as it advances. Currently the data building process is utilizing AWS Lambda, S3.

## Data

Data will be collected from various sources such as:
